**🌿PlantVision** is a deeplearning-powered plant disease detection system built with Python and PyTorch. It leverages a CNN architecture to classify 84 different kinds of plant diseases from 17 plants with a relatively high accuracy. Designed for offline mobile deployment, PlantVision aims to assist farmers, gardeners, and agricultural researchers in identifying plant diseases directly in the field.
